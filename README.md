### The Kate Bush Bard Instrument Generator

This Python 3.7 script generates a random instrument out of 35 unique options, all handpicked from [Kate Bush's discography](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kate_Bush_discography). These are not your conventional bard instruments, and the likelihood of some of them existing in your role-playing game might depend on your campaign's setting. I recommend that you generate at least three and discuss which one would work best for your character with your DM. :)

### How to run this script

After installing Python 3, just run this on your command prompt as `python3 kbbig.py`, no arguments necessary. Run through the program and you're set!
